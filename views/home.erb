						<p>
				The Mos Eisley Cantina was a drinking and dining establishment located in the city of Mos Eisley on the desert world of Tatooine. Although a dimly lit tavern known for frequent outbreaks of violence, it was a popular stopping point for pilots, making it an ideal place to hire crew for a starship.

				Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker came to the cantina shortly before the destruction of Alderaan to charter a course to that planet. They hired Han Solo and Chewbacca, who needed a way to pay off their debt to Jabba the Hutt. Their visit was not uneventful: the Jedi Master and his apprentice were harassed and confronted by Ponda Baba and Doctor Cornelius Evazan, while Solo had an altercation with the bounty hunter Greedo, whom he shot dead.
				The most popular drinks at the cantina were blue milk, Tatooine Sunset, Jawa Juice, Yatooni Boska, Tatooni Junko, and Hutt's Delight.

				Mos Eisley was located in a valley somewhere to the southeast of the Jundland Wastes[5] and roughly 80 kilometers north of Anchorhead, near the desert palace of Jabba the Hutt.

				From a distance, the spaceport appeared as a haphazard collage of low-grade duracrete, stone, and plastoid structures that spread outward from a central power and water distribution plant. The city lacked a main landing facility; therefore it relied on 362 individual hangars.[5] By order of the Empire, all of these hangars were equipped with time-lock devices.[5] Illegally parked vessels were not an uncommon sight.

				"Of all the crummy places in this port, why did you choose this one?"
				"Well, I do know the owner. He owes me for a bet we once made. I get to eat and drink here for free whenever I'm in town."
				"Oh, boy. What a thrill that must be. You ever try to eat anything in this place?"
				"I haven't been that hungry yet, no."
				―Princess Leia Organa and Lando Calrissian

				"Mos Eisley is known as the galaxy's armpit. I guess there are worse parts of the anatomy where we could be stuck."
				―Lando Calrissian

				"You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy."
