# sinatra_business_site
first sinatra business site
We are making a business site for the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine
We will have four pages and each will have similar layouts
We will have a centered content area with gutters on each side.
there will be the same banner image at the top of each page.
there will be a drop down navigation bar fixed to the side of each page.
there will be the same footer at the bottom of each page.
We will have a home page, an about us page, contact us page/form, and a menu image gallery.
We are using javascript and jQuery on the drop down menu and some fun animations on the site.
We we build the rest of the site on a ruby app and construct it using sinatra.
