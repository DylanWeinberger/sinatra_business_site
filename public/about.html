			Wuher was a human from Tatooine who worked as a bartender at the Mos Eisley Cantina.
			Wuher was an orphan, but worked his way off Tatooine's streets by studying biochemistry such as that he was able to learn what types of drinks would go down well with various species. He strongly disliked droids and installed a droid detector in the cantina to keep them out.

When his unit was deployed against a rebellion on Devaron, Malloc captured seven hundred rebel men, women, and children in the city of Montellian Serat and shelled the city. Interpreting his orders to move on without the prisoners as double-speak ordering their executions, he had all the prisoners rounded up and killed, earning him the nickname "The Butcher of Montellian Serat."
